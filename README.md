# AWS Project

I will add more text later.

For now, I want to make sure that this will look correct.

Things to still work on:

- [ ] Add function for ELB
- [ ] Automatically install nginx on new instances
- [ ] Create test environment
- [ ] Use waiters?
- [ ] Present availability zones as menu options?
